# InternshipTask-7
worked with a customer-order database to understand and implement SQL Views.


What We Did
    Created two tables:
        Customers: Stores customer details.
        Orders: Stores order details and links to customers via foreign key.
    Inserted sample data into both tables.
    Created various SQL views to:
        Combine and display customer and order data.
        Show filtered results like high-value orders.
        Aggregate data to show total spending per customer.
        Identify customers with no orders.
       Apply data restrictions using WITH CHECK OPTION.



 What We Learned

   What a view is: A virtual table based on a query.

   How to create views using CREATE VIEW.

   Why views are useful: abstraction, simplification, security, and reuse.

   How to restrict data changes using WITH CHECK OPTION.

   How to use joins and aggregations in views.

   Limitations: Not all views can be updated.

   Difference between views and materialized views.
